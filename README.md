# ProjectEuler
## Overview
The goal of this project is to go through as many of the Project Euler problems as possible. While exploring these problems I hope to expand my usage of other languages that I am not as familiar with.
## Directory Structure
Each problem will be contained within its own subdirectory, complete with its own README to help to explain how to use the code that has been made.
## Languages Used So Far
* C
* Haskell

## Tools Needed So Far
* Make
* ghci
