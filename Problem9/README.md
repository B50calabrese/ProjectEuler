# Problem 

This is my solution to Problem 9 of the Project Euler problems.
https://projecteuler.net/problem=9

## Description

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a^2 + b^2 = c^2
For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

## Usage

To build the code, the user must run the build.sh script.

To run the code, the user must type:
