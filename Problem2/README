This is my solution to Problem 2 of the Project Euler problems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description of problem:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

To build the code, you must have make installed.

Once make is installed, to build and run the program type:
make && ./fib
