This is my solution to Problem 1 of the Project Euler problems.

https://projecteuler.net/problem=1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description of problem:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get
3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the following code, you must have a Haskell interpreter of some kind.

Once you have the interpreter, in my case gchi you can execute the following:

gchi
:set prompt "gchi> "
multipleSum <N>

Here <N> is replaced with the value that we are getting multiples up to.
